Week 6

Reflection for the project and this week
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I was the visualizer for Group 8. When I got the project, I had no idea what to do, and how to well cooperate within our vertical group. I could imagine that the concept and the big picture for the project, however, coding was so hard to make, and understand through Ipython notebook. We could get the cleaned up data easily, by Tristan, CS major. For my part, however, visualizing was not that difficult to plotting on R. I tried to plot through python, but it seemed to hard and takes too much time. Thus, we decided to use R for the visualization. Within the horizontal group, we communicated with a Facebook, and it was good way to communicate. Since most of people are used to Facebook, I think that IRC does not convenient so far. We could discuss general plots that made for the vertical groups, but not specific plots due to the different approaches on visualizing. On our vertical group, we did communicated very well and we understood the role of each member very well. We did visit the Aaron’s office hour, it helped us much easier for the project. In addition, we had not that much technical problem, because we had two computer science majoring members. For the delta issues, we had to start earlier. As a visualizer, seriously, I had not much time to figure it out. I had just got the analyzed data on Sunday night, I had only one day to find the solution. At that time, this project gave me lots of stress since I also had midterms and essay for other classes on this week.

In the class, on this week, we had presentations for the projects and most of groups were awesome. In addition, on Thursday, we learned the idea of reproducible data. We tried to reproducing the data from other group’s project trough Github. It was very amazing stuff. Most of students has no experience with how reproducing data are great in the science field. Also I realized that operating with python and Github is treated for professionals in real world. For my case, it still seems really difficult to familiar, but I am willing to learn it more as day goes by.
