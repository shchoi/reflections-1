Week 5

On this week, we are formed a group by learning style; curator, analyzer, visualizer, and presenter. We discussed about the qualification for each rolls. And we were given the task which is questionnaire data wrangling. In addition, on Thursday, Professor Stark spoke about earthquake prediction. There were kind of difficult contents to understand that covered on Stat 135, but it was interesting task. In addition, I honestly didn't write a note on the lecture to share with other classmates.
I felt so confused after I got a group project. As a visualizer, I have no idea how to code and get some visual stuff with python notebook due to no experience with programming except R. And also, I'm wondering about how to display the presentation on the professor's system through IPython notebook or HTML5. However, even it would take so long time to figure out everything, I am so willing to learn about collaborative data science from this class, instructor, and classmates.
