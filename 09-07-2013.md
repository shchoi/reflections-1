Week 1

For this week, I encountered the problems that understanding the pull requests through ‘github’. I could not understand the concept of that, and how to do it, and why we need to do. However, I could get method by classmate. Also, it was challenge for me to coding such as 'sudo installing' and 'ipython notebook', when we work with the virtualbox in class. It was not working when we tried to get the ip address from virtualbox and put into explorer. I was not familiar with github, and could not understand the reason to use. However, I could understand the function for the fork, pull request stuff. In addition, I had some problem to set up the pidgin and join the chat room. At that point, I even didn't know the 'IRC' and wasted lots of times, but I could get the ideas and solutions by web searching. By using IRC through Pidgin, I can also ask some questions and get helpful answers. It is great tools to work and share the ideas with classmates.
