Week 8

Reflection
------------------------------------------------
On this week, we talked about what we are going to do for the remaining class.
In addition, we discussed about some ideas for final goal and some troubles among each horizontal groups.  However, we need to figure out the final task since most of students are confusing for that final project. Thus, the class should deal our object specifically. For the rest of semester, we are going to do several steps; public understand of science, reproducible programming from the data, and write papers includes abstract summary, intro, methods and citation. 

In addition, we talked about important concept that SMART, which is Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This is great method to do well on this class. I feel like it is going to be little bit difficult to get the great idea and concept from the scientific issues. However, I am really willing to learn this tough project.
