Reflection

Week 3

On this week, the classes were great. I was really fascinated by the lectures about “Meadow” and “Earthquake”. I could realize that a statistical analysis have an effect on different fields of study. From the lecture by Eric Berlow, I could get an insight into the new field, the ecology with the statistical analysis. Specifically, we focused on the prediction about the meadow with lots of variables through several types of methods, such as GLM, GAM, etc. Even though I’ve never had interest in and learned about those studies, it led me to research more references and articles.

In addition, the lecture by Prof. Stark was also perfect to refresh my memories (i.e. t-tests, permutation test, ANOVA test, and etc.). With the “Earthquake” problem, we learned how the tests are constructed, and how to analyze with the real data. Since I took Stat 135 class a long time ago, I felt the need to prepare the basic materials before we go on.

On Friday morning, I went to the GSIs and tried to install and fix up the Linux. Due to problems with Windows 8 and disk volume, however, we couldn’t install it. I think I need to solve this situation, as soon as possible on this weekend.
