Week 2

Last week, we could not connect the server through VirtualBox. Thus, in this week, we downloaded and installed “Vagrant,” open-source software for managing virtual development environments. I could not understand the reason why we use it, but I could do by attending the office hour and doing some searching for myself; it was a really great tool, and I thought that it would let me approach the matter in a way more effective way. When there is an ongoing program developing, the usual programming set takes more time. Mainly related is that as the number of engaged developers goes up, the managing task takes more time. To solve those problems, we use Vagrant. It helps you to control VirtualBox more easily.

We also installed the ‘vagrant ubutu cloud image’ through powershell and made the project1 file. The job was not tough, but it was difficult to understand why we were doing that. Also, I should have gone through harder times had I dealt with the matter alone.

I was still unfamiliar with Github, and couldn’t understand why it is a good tool for this class. However, as knowing what is ‘pull requests’ and why we use it, I changed my mind and got interested in it. Moreover, the office hour helped me a lot in that professor showed me how things work in a visual manner. Even though I was totally new to concepts of programming and the material that the class is dealing with, the professor treated me very friendly.

On Thursday, we discussed about “plus” and “delta.” I have never heard those terms, but I quickly got that the two terms mean “strength” and “weakness” respectively. Within each group, the group members talked about “plus” and “delta.” Among s several “deltas” what interested me most that IRC cannot communicate when no one is online. I always checked whenever I use my laptop, but there are only a few people online. That was the reason we could not communicate not much outside the class. During this feedback, ‘plus’ and ‘delta’, I felt it is great tools to share the ideas to make progress and share our opinion for the class.

As a part of the watching assignment, I watched TED by Eric Berlow, an ecologist, on how to simplify the complex problems. It was a great lecture about how to look and get an insight into the seemingly complex problems. People tend to be overwhelmed by the overall complexities of the problems. However, if you take a step backward and look the entire matter, you could break the problems into several smaller components, which helps you to solve the whole problem. Again, it was an amazing clip.
