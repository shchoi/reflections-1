Week 12

Sung Hoon Choi

--------------------

First of all, our Heart group went to the Aaron's OH today, but he didn't come... we sent him an email with a fun picture of us. We had to discuss the next steps, since ohter visuallizer group, Quakers, did most of coding and graphing. 

On this week, our group worked on Smart goals for next steps during the class. Fortunately, we collaborated with analyzer group members, and it was very helpful.

In addition, Jinsoo and I read and summarized chapter 2 of Luen's paper, and posted on the github repository.
