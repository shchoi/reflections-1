Week 4
On this week, we discussed about "Reproducible and Collaborative Data Science". Quite honestly, I had no ideas and knowledge until recently.  Also, I couldn't understand what it is exactly and what we were going to do in the class. However, Aaron and Chris's speech helped me a lot in that he showed us how the Reproducible work in a visual manner. I could get more understanding of why and what we need to do. From the measurements, we put the data and get models by analysis. Then, we do reproduce the model with the other data. I think it is mightily important. In any line of research (e.g. geology, bio, ecology, medicine, etc.), the reproducible would be a significant part for the researchers. I feel very excited to learn this awesome work. 
During the discussion on Friday, there were some complaints about a rate of progress for the class. However, I don't feel it was late as an unfamiliar person with Python and other programming. I just installed iPython and ready to go with it. For me, although I've changed to Mac, installing was a little bit tough. In addition, I needed more time to understand the concept of iPython and Virtualbox. In my opinion, even though I understand with slow tempo for some students, I agree with Aaron's argument that we should wait for students who were not prepared.
