Week 9

Sung Hoon Choi

----------------------------------------------------------------------
This week, we talked about what we will be doing for the rest of semester.
Within the group, we discussed difficulties that we encounter, our accomplishment, and questions.
 
Generally, the biggest issues are following:

-       Data curator: Geographic, time period, formats, data sources
-       Analyzer: ETAS Model, imports to models
-       Visualizer: What kind of graphs or tools we are going to use (python, D3, etc.)
-       Presenter: story, big picture, output format, presentation
 
However, the most important problem is that many of us have no sense of what we should do. This project seems like creating something out of nothing and it literally killed us. Honestly, the concept and thesis were so difficult to understand that even Chris helped us in class. 
 
On Thursday, all groups had lots of time to discuss about everything for the project and the class. It helped us to organize and cooperate for the goal.  As a visualizer, I had lots of troubles. We had a bunch of roadblocks and questions.
-       learning the needed tools (D3)
-       understanding the thesis of the project
-       coordinating schedules
-       assigning tasks to group members
 
Most of our members had troubles with programming and no one has experience with D3. Thus, I think we need to find a way to learn the tools for visualization as soon as possible. I know that we need to go to Aaronâ€™s office hours, but I feel a lot of pressures with every single step of projects, honestly.
